## Features

- **Custom RAG Pipeline**: Specifically tailored to handle the complexities of telecommunications standards.
- **Enhanced Query Processing**: Implements a dual-stage query enhancement and retrieval process, improving the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optimized for the best performance by fine-tuning chunk sizes, context length, and embedding models.
- **NN Router**: A neural network-based router that enhances document retrieval efficiency while significantly reducing RAM usage.
- **Open-Source**: Freely available for the community to use, adapt, and improve.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Telco-RAG**, clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netop-team/telco-rag.git
cd telco-rag
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Node.js

Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

Install the necessary Python packages and download the 3GPP knowledge database:

```bash
cd ./Telco-RAG_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
```

### Running the Full Pipeline

To run the full pipeline, open the first terminal window and execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open two terminals: one for the frontend and one for the Telco-RAG backend. You can access the frontend via your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Running Only the API Server

Open a second terminal window and run the API server using this command:

```bash
cd ./Telco-RAG_api
uvicorn api.deploy_api:app --reload
```
